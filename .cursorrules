# SoundSync Technologies

SoundSync uses the following technologies:

- **Node.js + Express**: Backend server framework
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication for audio synchronization
- **HTML5 Audio API**: For audio playback across devices
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For client-side functionality
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design

The implementation leverages WebSockets through Socket.IO to ensure real-time audio synchronization between devices on the same network.

Description:

# Plan

- Create a website that allows users connected to the same WiFi/hotspot to listen to synchronized audio
- The first user to connect becomes the host and controls the audio playback
- When the host plays any sound, all other connected devices play the same sound in real-time
- Implementation uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between devices
- Single page website with responsive design
- Host can upload audio files and control playback (play, pause, seek)
- All clients automatically synchronize with the host's playback

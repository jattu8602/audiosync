# Plan

- Plan is in my mind to create a website which shows user connected to the same hotspot/wifi basically the first user enters in the website must be the host and if host plays any kind of sound in their device then other connected devices plays same sound real time
- You can use any technology for making it just let me know and tech me how you are implementing everthing 
- Update cursorrules files too if any update is there
- This gonna be just a one page website with complex tasks
